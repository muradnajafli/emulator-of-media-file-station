# Emulator of media file station  

## Purpose: 
Get familiar with Kotlin static (companion object), operators overloading. Also, get familiar with delegation in Kotlin. 

## Description:
You should create the emulator of media file station, which allows you to download, play and edit some video.  
- This application contains downloader, editor and player of some video files. Downloader should emulate downloading and recording video file to your own storage. Editor should emulate editing videos from the file list (that contains in your storage) into one. 
- For all operations with files you should use operator overloading and delegation depending on the situation (all details you can find in java documentation in the template) 
- Results of downloading, editing and playing should be printing in console 
- Application must handle cases, when emulator get incorrect data (all details also in java doc) 

## Task: 
Create a program that meets the requirements from the description. What do you need to do: 
- Read java doc (you can find it inside of classes). Java doc includes some additional information. 
- Check codebase and solve all compilation errors 
- Instead “TODO()” fill functions body by your own Kotlin code that will complete program and will pass unit tests

# Emulator of media file station  

## Purpose: 
Get familiar with the Kotlin static (companion object) and the operators overloading. Also, get familiar with the delegation in Kotlin. 

## Description:
You should create the emulator of the media file station, which allows you to download, play and edit videos.
- This application should contain a downloader, an editor, and a player of some video files. The downloader should emulate downloading and recording video files to your own storage. The editor should emulate editing videos from the file list (which are contained in your storage) into one.
- For all operations with files you should use operator overloading and delegation depending on the situation (all details you can find in java documentation in the template).
- Results of downloading, editing, and playing should be printing in the console.
- Application must handle cases, when the emulator gets incorrect data (all details are also in java doc).

## Task: 
Create a program that meets the requirements from the description. What you need to do:
- Read java doc (you can find it inside classes). Java doc includes some additional information. 
- Check codebase and solve all compilation errors.
- Change “TODO()” and fill the functions body with your own Kotlin code that will complete the program and will pass unit tests.
